## How to build

Made using Marp in VS Code with Marp for VS Code extension. Can be built with `marp-cli`. Need relatively recent node and npm.

`npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli`


`marp slides.md --html`

Should also work with npm scripts from package definition. Mostly copied from https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example .
